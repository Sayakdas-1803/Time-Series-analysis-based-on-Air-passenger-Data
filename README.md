In this time series analysis, we explore the underlying patterns in the data by decomposing it into key components, with a particular focus on trend and seasonality.

Trend Analysis: We examine the long-term movement in the data, identifying whether the series exhibits an upward, downward, or stable trend over time. This helps in understanding the overall direction and growth patterns.

Seasonality Detection: We investigate recurring short-term fluctuations that follow a fixed periodic pattern (e.g., daily, monthly, or yearly cycles). Seasonal decomposition techniques (such as additive or multiplicative models) are applied to isolate and analyze these patterns.
